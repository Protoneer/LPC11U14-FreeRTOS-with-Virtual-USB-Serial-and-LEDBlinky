/** @defgroup USB_Virtual_Serial_Device_18xx43xx Virtual Serial Device
 * @ingroup EXAMPLES_USB_18XX43XX
 * <b>Example description</b><br>
 * This example implements a CDC/ACM (USB-to-COM) virtual serial device. The
 * example reads and writes data through a serial port on the chip which is
 * connected to either 9pin UART connector or a dedicated USB-to-COM chip
 * (FTDI) on the board.
 *
 * CDC demo need driver for running, follow these steps for install this driver:
 * Right click on "My Computer" and select manage
 * Go to device manager, right click to undefined device and select "Update Driver Software"
 * Select "Browse for driver software on your computer", point to "lpcusblib_VirtualSerial" folder and select "Next" until finish
 * Sometime this driver can be conflicted with Audio driver (Audio Input Device),
 * in this case, follow these steps :
 * Right click on "My Computer" and select manage
 * Go to device manager, uninstall this example's driver(exactly driver in Universal Serial Bus controllers)
 * Unplug and plug this device again, it will work well.<br>
